## SparseRC
Our method is called SparseRC (from sparser root causes). To use it you can simply install Python with the required packages in [`sparserc_requirements.txt`](sparserc/sparserc_requirements.txt
)

A demonstration of our DAG learning method is shown in [`SparseRC_demo.ipynb`](SparseRC_demo.ipynb)


### Method description
We consider the formulation of linear SEMs as a linear transformation of the input (defined as root causes) that gives the data as output. 
![Root causes](sparserc/image.png)

Motivated by this new formulation we propose the novel DAG learning method that assumes sparsity in the input side - namely few root causes.

## Full experiment reproducibility 
Current version of the code was run successfully in Windows 11 with python 3.9.7.

### Environment and packages
Setup the python environment:

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n sparserc python=3.9.7
conda activate sparserc

# install all requirements with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Special care must be taken for installing the pydot package.
We suggest installation using conda.
```bash
# install pydot with conda
conda install pydot
```

### Other repos

Then manually import the following repositories. 
```bash
# install py-causal repo
pip install git+https://github.com/bd2kccd/py-causal

# clone the following repositories
cd neurips_experiments/methods/
git clone https://github.com/xunzheng/notears

Make sure to have R installed and that the path to the R directory in file **experiment.py** is correct. Also note the required packages on R for the [causal discovery toolbox](https://fentechsolutions.github.io/CausalDiscoveryToolbox/html/index.html).
